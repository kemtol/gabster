GABSTER people is a movement to empower other fashion entreprenuers, workers, and students. We share stories from entrepreneurs on how they start the brand, how to maintain their brand, and how to grow them. Each entreprenurs have different side or a story and they all worth watching for. We aim to show the world that fashion industry is not just about glamour, but there is a lot of energy and work put into it. The industry is not as glamorous, but we fashion people enjoy our work and desire to inspire and empower our community.
