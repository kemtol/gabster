Create a 2D blueprint of your idea. Get a production-ready pattern with face card and sewing instructions.

This step in apparel manufacturing not only takes skill, but is very important in creating a tangible representation of your vision. Today, we can digitize this technical request, but also typically create paper patterns too.

Each brand works with a personal production manager who is your point of contact throughout the entire manufacturing process. Our production managers provide guidance and support through all stages of apparel manufacturing. They will track and communicate each step of the production process and keep to strict deadlines to deliver the goods. We only partner with brands who have shared success in mind.
