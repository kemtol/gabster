Just is an Indonesian brand that is inspired by a person's daily routine. They started off by launching pajamas for men and women and have recently added casual wear to their line. Their casual wear collection is only available for women and ranges from top, dresses, bottoms, and outerwear for several occasions.

## What We Do Best
GABSTER goes to Seoul in November 2018 to do the first lookbook shoot in Korea, bringing local brands for global campaign. We work together with local photographers and make sure to pick the right model and locations for Just. It is important for us to create a good lookbook that can represent the collection well.
