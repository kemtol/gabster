opener: Working with GFC has been a breeze. Me and my partner does not have background
  in fashion, nor having great amount of knowledge and network in fashion industry.
  We always believe that we make awesome products, but always have difficulties in
  expanding our sales channel.

Thanks to GFC’s network, we were able to obtain more sales channel and work with big department stores and online marketplaces that we weren’t able to get in touch with before. Also, we are currently working on collaborations with other local brands to further expand our market. More importantly, GFC is very eager to work hard with us. They are swift and willing to give feedback and insight anytime we need. We won’t have any second thought to continue working with GFC.
