And so, in this kind of game, whoever gets the most information will win it. GFC helps me a lot in getting all this info. Whether it is about the upcoming trend, which e commerce is booming, what kind of style is selling, or how to grow your sales to the different generations from baby boomers to millennials. GFC knows it all. With GFC vast connections in fashion and relevant info, I have managed to grow Third Day from an unknown brand to a brand that anyone from gen x to millennials would wear. Sales has grown from 4 stores to 42 stores both online and offline and now we are thinking of expanding outside of Indonesia. GFC encourages me to keep growing bigger.
