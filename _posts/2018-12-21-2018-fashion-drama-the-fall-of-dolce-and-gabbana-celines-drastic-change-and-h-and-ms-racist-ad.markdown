In January, H&M received a major backlash over their advertisement that features a black child wearing a sweatshirt with the phrase "Coolest Monkey in The Jungle." After consumers erupted in outrage for what they deemed to be a racist move, the brand took down the picture from their website. 

Many people including influencers turned to social media to express their anger, including Canadian singer The Weeknd, who has collaborated with H&M in the past. He stated on Twitter that he will no longer work with H&M and was deeply offended. In South Africa, angry protesters ransacked several stores, tearing down shop displays and throwing clothes around.

## Nike's Controversial Campaign

In September, Nike Launched an advertising campaign for the 30th anniversary of the brand's famous Just Do It slogan that features ex-San Francisco player, Colin Kaepernick. The ad features his picture alongside the message "Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything." This caused a major outbreak of angry people but also people who support the campaign.

Kaepernick, began kneeling during the national anthem of The United States in 2016 to protest against police brutality towards African-Americans and soon after, several players followed too. The 2017 season was then marked by numerous protests during the pre-game anthems. The US President, Donald Trump spoke out against those involved and called for players to be fined or suspended by teams for taking part.

The backlash came in hours after Colin Kaepernick, tweeted that he will be starring in Nike's iconic "Just Do It" Campaign. Following that, hashtags #BoycottNike and #JustBurnIt started trending on Twitter with some angry consumers posting photos and videos of themselves burning their Nike shoes and other products to protest. The backlash was no surprise and Nike believes that it's worth angering conservative Americans and supporters of Donald Trump.

Despite the backlash that they have received, many showed support and respect towards the company for the diverse figure in its campaign. Nike has also experienced a rocket increase in sales since this ad.
