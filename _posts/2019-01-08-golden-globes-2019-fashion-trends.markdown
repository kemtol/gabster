It was the Golden Globes 2019 and you know what that means. We had our eyes set not only for the nominees but also for the fashion and beauty trend on the red carpet. Last year's Golden Globes was mostly filled with celebrities wearing the color black as a tribute to a campaign launched by some of Hollywood's most powerful women to combat sexual harassment across industries. Now, Hollywood's biggest stars arrived in bold and glamorous ensembles. GABSTER Fashion Consulting has curated the fashion trends spotted on the red carpet.

There is always that one color that stands out most on the red carpet and for this year's Golden Globes it was nude. Not just simply the color nude but in the shades of nude, beige, pink and cream.
