2018 is coming to an end and before the new year begins, GABSTER Fashion Consulting has curated the fashion highlights of this year. From iconic fashion shows to important markets, we covered it all. Keep reading to reminisce on this year's fashion.

## Iconic Fashion Shows

During the Fall 2018 Ready-To-Wear show, Gucci surprised us with a model cradling a baby dragon and some models holding their own head on the runway. It was sensational, yet disturbing and creepy but people loved it. Another exciting about fashion show was Fendi's as the brand showcased its collaboration collection with Fila. Not only was the show a success, but the collection itself became popular amongst the market. 

Fendi was not the only brand to showcase their collaboration collection. Kith outdid them by doing a four-part show featuring collaborations with Tommy Hilfiger, Greg Lauren, and Versace. A highly anticipated fashion show was Celine's Hedi Slimane debut since becoming the new artistic director. The show received mixed reactions and many were not happy with it because many pointed out that the collection looks very similar to Slimane's previous works.

A unique fashion show we had this year was Calvin Klein's . Instead of a usual runway platform, the brand used popcorn for the models to walk on. Then, finally we have Dior Men's Pre-fall 2019 show which was held in Tokyo, Japan. This show turned heads with its futuristic theme and celebrity guests. 

## Brands Re-Branding

2018 was the year of re-branding and changing the brand logo into a more minimalistic one. Especially because brands need to stay relevant in order to keep up with the fast-changing customer, especially the Millenials, Gen Z, and soon Alpha. 

Burberry changed its logo and monogram under Riccardo Tisci's direction. Their new monogram, a T and B interlocked, pays tribute to the brand’s founder, Thomas Burberry and will be used in new advertising campaigns and most likely show up on scarves, as jacket linings, and other Tisci designs. 

Berluti also unveiled a new logo under the artistic direction of Kris Van Assche. It has been created in collaboration with graphic design studio M/M Paris. The designer drew his inspiration from the brand's origin. The new "1895 Berluti Paris" logo features the brand's name and the year the founder established himself as a shoemaker. The corners have been subtly erased to symbolize new beginnings.

For the first time in 80 years, Balmain is rebranding and coming out with a new logo. The brand is planning to transform from a niche player to a powerhouse, therefore some strategies have been established. Balmain introduced its new logo just as the company is about to launch its accessories, hiring an in-house team to manage sales and production for the category that has highly favorable in retail and is key to the luxury fashion market. Now, buyers can see the handbags, embossed with the new logo and monogram at Balmain’s showroom in Paris. Besides that, the brand also plans to launch a cosmetic range. Balmain is also targeting wealthy fans and opening more stores while also focusing on their online sales. To attract more consumers, the brand is investing more on entertainment, innovation and technology.

Lastly, Celine debuted its new logo under artistic, creative and image director Hedi Slimane. The french luxury label’s new logo is influenced by the original design from the 1960s with a modernist typography from the 1930s resulting in the accent on the ‘E’ being removed and the spacing between the letters tightened to create a balanced and simplified logo.
