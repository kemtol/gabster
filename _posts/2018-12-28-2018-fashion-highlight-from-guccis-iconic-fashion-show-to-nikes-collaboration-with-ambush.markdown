2018 is coming to an end and before the new year begins, GABSTER Fashion Consulting has curated the fashion highlights of this year. From iconic fashion shows to important markets, we covered it all. Keep reading to reminisce on this year's fashion.

## Iconic Fashion Shows

During the Fall 2018 Ready-To-Wear show, Gucci surprised us with a model cradling a baby dragon and some models holding their own head on the runway. It was sensational, yet disturbing and creepy but people loved it. Another exciting about fashion show was Fendi's as the brand showcased its collaboration collection with Fila. Not only was the show a success, but the collection itself became popular amongst the market. 

Fendi was not the only brand to showcase their collaboration collection. Kith outdid them by doing a four-part show featuring collaborations with Tommy Hilfiger, Greg Lauren, and Versace. A highly anticipated fashion show was Celine's Hedi Slimane debut since becoming the new artistic director. The show received mixed reactions and many were not happy with it because many pointed out that the collection looks very similar to Slimane's previous works.

A unique fashion show we had this year was Calvin Klein's . Instead of a usual runway platform, the brand used popcorn for the models to walk on. Then, finally we have Dior Men's Pre-fall 2019 show which was held in Tokyo, Japan. This show turned heads with its futuristic theme and celebrity guests. 

## Brands Re-Branding

2018 was the year of re-branding and changing the brand logo into a more minimalistic one. Especially because brands need to stay relevant in order to keep up with the fast-changing customer, especially the Millenials, Gen Z, and soon Alpha. 

Burberry changed its logo and monogram under Riccardo Tisci's direction. Their new monogram, a T and B interlocked, pays tribute to the brand’s founder, Thomas Burberry and will be used in new advertising campaigns and most likely show up on scarves, as jacket linings, and other Tisci designs. 

Berluti also unveiled a new logo under the artistic direction of Kris Van Assche. It has been created in collaboration with graphic design studio M/M Paris. The designer drew his inspiration from the brand's origin. The new "1895 Berluti Paris" logo features the brand's name and the year the founder established himself as a shoemaker. The corners have been subtly erased to symbolize new beginnings.

For the first time in 80 years, Balmain is rebranding and coming out with a new logo. The brand is planning to transform from a niche player to a powerhouse, therefore some strategies have been established. Balmain introduced its new logo just as the company is about to launch its accessories, hiring an in-house team to manage sales and production for the category that has highly favorable in retail and is key to the luxury fashion market.

Lastly, Celine debuted its new logo under artistic, creative and image director Hedi Slimane. The french luxury label’s new logo is influenced by the original design from the 1960s with a modernist typography from the 1930s resulting in the accent on the ‘E’ being removed and the spacing between the letters tightened to create a balanced and simplified logo.

## Unexpected Collaborations

In 2018, we had some unexpected collaborations coming from classic brands partnering up with streetwear brands to a furniture company with a clothing brand. 

One of the least expected collaborations was between Palace and Polo Ralph Lauren. This was the first time that Polo Ralph Lauren collaborated with a streetwear brand because they aimed to be more relatable to the current market. The other classic x streetwear brand collaboration was between Kith and Tommy Hilfiger.  Kith dug into Hilfiger’s archive and redesigned classic and rarest pieces through a modern lens. 

Following their Spring/Summer 2018 collaboration, Supreme and Levis released a new exclusive collection for the Fall/Winter 2018 collection with six styles. Alexander Wang and Uniqlo also collaborated on creating a unisex line that used Heattech fabric and includes bodysuits, T-shirts, leggings, bras, and briefs for men and women. 

The oddest collaboration though this year was by Ikea and Off-White. The range of furniture was designed by Virgil Abloh in which he added the signature Off-White quotation marks. Some other collaborations we had this year were Fendi x Fila, Kaws x Dior, H&M x Moschino, Nike x Ambush and from our local brands was a collaboration between Socky x Never Too Lavish. 

## Important Markets

In 2018, we gained new important markets and brands are adapting to it. With the increase of modest wear, millennial Muslims are becoming a target. Modest wear has become increasingly popular, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and America. There is a global demand now from people and millennial Muslims who want to dress modest and stylish.

Chinese millennials are one of the most important market, especially for luxury brands. This year, it has been proven that they play a big role in the sales of luxury goods. 

Millennial parents are also becoming an important target market. They enjoy dressing up their children and do not mind spending extra money to buy their children cute clothes. Not only that, but matching outfits between a parent and their child has also become a high demand.

Now, is the time for brands to listen to the demands of the generation z. It is important to know how to approach them and brands need to adapt to that. The Tokyo Men fashion scene has become very popular this year and brands such as Dior has proven it by holding the pre-fall 2019 fashion show there. This market is becoming important for menswear and brands need to keep that in mind.
