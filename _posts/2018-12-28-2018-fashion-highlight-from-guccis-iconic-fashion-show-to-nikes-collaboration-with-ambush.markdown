## Iconic Fashion Shows

During the Fall 2018 Ready-To-Wear show, Gucci surprised us with a model cradling a baby dragon and some models holding their own head on the runway. It was sensational, yet disturbing and creepy but people loved it. Another exciting about fashion show was Fendi's as the brand showcased its collaboration collection with Fila. Not only was the show a success, but the collection itself became popular amongst the market. 

Fendi was not the only brand to showcase their collaboration collection. Kith outdid them by doing a four-part show featuring collaborations with Tommy Hilfiger, Greg Lauren, and Versace. A highly anticipated fashion show was Celine's Hedi Slimane debut since becoming the new artistic director. The show received mixed reactions and many were not happy with it because many pointed out that the collection looks very similar to Slimane's previous works.

A unique fashion show we had this year was Calvin Klein's . Instead of a usual runway platform, the brand used popcorn for the models to walk on. Then, finally we have Dior Men's Pre-fall 2019 show which was held in Tokyo, Japan. This show turned heads with its futuristic theme and celebrity guests.
