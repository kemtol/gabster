This year, Inditex has announced that Zara will expand online to 106 additional countries, mostly in Africa. This means that Zara will be available to shop online in 202 countries. Zara customers in Angola, Ivory Coast and Indonesia will be able to place orders in euros including shipping costs and custom charges.

It's the era of modest wear and 2019 is no different. Luxury e-commerce platform, The Modist is leading it and their market comes from all around the world. This proves that modest dressing is not only for religious purposes but also for those women who dresses like this as it’s her aesthetic or she’s of a certain faith or she’s at work and it’s most appropriate to be modest. The reason varies but it’s obvious it’s a very relevant thing to women in this day and age and there is a very high demand for modest wear.

Nike has collaborated with many brands last year and this year will be no different. We can already expect more collaborations from the brand and perhaps there will be an unexpected one? We will just have to wait and see. 

## What's Next for 2019

Artificial Intelligence is taking over and it has been applied in many retail stores. Several retailers have used smart fixtures that can also help track customer data as rails and displays are developed with tech elements. This will also help the retailer to ensure better operational efficiency. We can also expect more tech solutions for store collections and returns. Brands such as ZARA has already implemented this at their flagship store in London, where customers can scan their order QR code or provide a pin number to activate the automated warehouse which will then collect their purchase.

Alibaba is one of the biggest e-commerce platforms and more brands are joining them. Their other platforms, Tao Bao and Pavilion has also been on the rise in 2018. Not long ago, Alibaba has signedan agreement with Belgium government to launch an e-commerce trade hub which will include investments in logistic infrastructure. This project is part of Alibaba’s Electronic World Trade Platform (eWTP). Alibaba’s logistic, Cainiao, will lease a logistic port at Belgium’s Liege airport and operations will begin in 2021. The company is confident that under the eWTP, they will open a huge potential for European businesses to enter the global market. Surely, this year will be no different for Alibaba as the company keeps on evolving.

Retailers are implementing the online store experience to the offline store. To bring this to life, brands are giving experiences for their customers to the store. Such as a buy online, pick up in store service, create fun events and do installations that will attract visitors.
