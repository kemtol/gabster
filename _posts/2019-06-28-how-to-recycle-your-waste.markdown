The fashion industry does not close its eyes to this problem. Because of the waste produced from the production of clothing is very much.

Emily Bode has a different story, the owner of a men's clothing label who just held a runway in Paris, the couple launched several products from leftover ingredients. Waste materials tend to be cheaper than buying new materials. Therefore many designers make this an opportunity to increase their business. "Every dress has a story, whether it's textiles that are reproduced or it's a product of the 1940s," said Emily Bode.

Another consideration for fashion business entrepreneurs, they can take advantage of deadstock to produce new goods. But the challenge is that business people must always develop their source strategies.

Indonesian local products can be more confident to start the "sustainable fashion" movement. Just the big world brands have started real actions and made big profits, don't let them lose. Support local products that are environmentally friendly.
